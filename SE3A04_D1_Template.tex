\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% Begin Section
This SRS will describe the software requiremnets for GeoLens, a community-driven application for identifying
locations based on images, descriptitons and discussions. This document outlines the system's overall purpose, the context for building the application,
functional and non-functional requirements and user iteraction.

\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sub:purpose}
% Begin SubSection
This document serves as a guideline for developers, designers, QA engineers, project managers and other stakeholders, ensuring a clear understanding of the system, including it's objectives, users, expected behavior, and technical constraints.
As the project progresses and changes, the document will provide a baseline from which these changes can be compared. This SRS may also aid in risk identification early in the project lifecycle by outlining dependencies and constraints, allowing managers to prevent risks.
% End SubSection

\subsection{Scope}
\label{sub:scope}
% Begin SubSection
GeoLens is a community and AI driven application designed to identify locations from images. It consists of several individual software products described below.\\

The \textbf{Forum} UI is the primary interface where users interact with GeoLens. It allows users to upload images of locations for identification, view responses, and
engage with the community. If the forum UI can provide ease of use and an interactive experience it will encourage community engagement and bring traffic to the
application. The interface facilitates discussions, displays aggregated predictions, and contains gamification elements such as leaderboards. The forum UI should be accessible
to all users, intuitive to use and respond to user requests within 100 ms. It does not perform image analysis or identification itself but serves as the user’s gateway to the platform.\\

The \textbf{Orchestrator} is responsible for handling submitted images, delegating tasks to experts,
and returning the final result to users. The Orchestrator should coordinate system components concurrently, managing task distribution, monitoring progress, and aggregating responses to ensure quick and accurate results. It handles task prioritization, load balancing, and error recovery while maintaining seamless interactions between users and experts.
The back end does not analyze images directly but functions as the between layer that processes requests and returns items to the forum.\\

The \textbf{Host DBMS} stores user account information, historical user interactions, reputation scores, previously identified locations and leaderboards. It ensures that the system retains valuable data,
in a structured way that is efficiently accessible by other system components. The database should be highly secure, as it contains sensitive user information. The database does not process images or make
identifications but acts as the central location for all platform data. \\

The three \textbf{Experts} are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{GeoKnowr AI}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Pre-trained image processing model
        \item Predicts coordinates where an image was taken
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Landmark Recognition}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Google images API
        \item Search by image to locate a popular landmark
    \end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Region Specific AI}
	\begin{itemize}
        \item Uses a specialized AI model trained for a specific region
        \item Enhances accuracy for areas with distinct visual features
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The primary goal of these experts is to work cohesively to provide an accurate prediction with little delay. GeoKnowr AI aims to deliver an initial estimate
of where an image was taken by assigning coordinates. Then the region specific AI can further refine this prediction by applying localized knowledge. If a landmark is 
present in the image, the Landmark Recognition software should pin point it's location.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide a complete list of all documents referenced elsewhere in the SRS.
	\item Identify each document by title, report number (if applicable), date, and publishing organization.
	\item Specify the sources from which the references can be obtained.
	\item Order this list in some sensible manner (alphabetical by author, or something else that makes more sense).

\section{Overall Product Description}
\label{sec:overall_description}
% Begin Section

% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item This section should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements. 
% 	\item It does not state specific requirements.
% 	\item It provides a \emph{background} for those requirements and makes them easier to understand.
% \end{itemize}


\subsection{Product Perspective}
\label{sub:product_perspective}

\noindent GeoLens is a mobile game guessing app developed for the Android platform. A similar product is GeoGuessr, which allows users to guess the location of randomly given locations from a Google Street View. However, GeoLens requires a user to submit a picture of a location they wish to identify. The application will consult three specialized experts: a lightweight AI called GeoKnowr which is based off of GeoGuessr, a Landmark Recognition service, and a region-specific generative AI. Each expert will return a confidence level and if the confidence level meets a predefined threshold of 70\%, then that expert's response will be returned in the same order as above.\\

\noindent In addition to the AI-driven location identification, GeoLens has a unique gameplay feature with competition modes, where players can play against each other individually, with real-time score tracking and leaderboards. Additionally, the product will allow users to create and modify profiles that will be used in the app. This means that a log-in and sign-up feature will be required.\\

\noindent The system architecture consists of multiple layers. Firstly, there is the Host DBMS layer for storing user profiles, previously submitted images, as well as game history. Secondly, there is the Orchestrator Wrapper which is responsible for managing images, managing accounts, and allowing users to engage in competition mode. Next is the external AI layer which is where the Image Identification Service module calls on to identify photos, where it calls upon a confidence evaluator, which aggregates responses from multiple AI models to determine the most accurate result. Lastly, the Figure UI layer is where the user interacts with GeoLens.\\

\subsection{Product Functions}
\label{sub:product_functions}
% Begin SubSection

\noindent There will be 4 modules in the product: Image Management, Account Services, Competition Mode, and the Image Identification Service. The major functions of the software in Image  Management include uploading images, allowing users in Competition Mode to see the picture of a location and make a guess, providing additional context for images, and sending images for AI processing. Within Account Services, there are functions of creating and updating accounts, and logging in. Competition Mode allows users to engage in challenges, view leaderboards, and compete in multiplayer mode. Lastly, Image Identification Services involves AI models processing images, evaluating their confidence, and returning predictions for the location.\\

\noindent The following table outlines the major functions within each module:

%\begin{itemize}
%	\item List any assumptions you made in interpreting what the software being developed is aiming to achieve
%	\item List any other assumptions you made that, if it fails to hold, could require you to change the requirements
	%\item List each of the factors that affect the requirements stated in the SRS
	%\item These factors are not design constraints on the software but are, rather, any changes to them that can affect the requirements in the SRS
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item \textbf{Example}: An assumption may be that a specific operating system will be available on the hardware designated for the software product. If, in fact, the operating system is not available, the SRS would then have to change accordingly.

%	\item You do not need to provide the textual description of any of the use cases here (these will be specified under "Highlights of Functional Requirements").
%	\item Provide \emph{one} use case diagram for the most important Business Event.
%	\item The text of all use cases will be specified under "Highlights of Functional Requirements"

\section{Highlights of Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:functional_requirements}
% Begin Section
\begin{itemize}
	\item Specify all use cases (or other scenarios triggered by other events), organized by Business Event. 
	\item For each Business Event, show the scenario from every Viewpoint. You should have the same set of Viewpoints across all Business Events. If a Viewpoint doesn't participate, write N/A so we know you considered it still. You can choose how to present this - keep in mind it should be easy to follow. 
	\item At the end, combine them all into a Global Scenario.
	%\item Specify the "use cases" (or other triggering events) organized by Business Event. (The Global Scenario is what you might think of as a use case). Be sure to consider Business Events that aren't just triggered by users with goals (e.g. something happens in the environment that your system needs to respond to)
	\item Your focus should be on what the system needs to do, not how to do it. Specify it in enough detail that it clearly specifies what needs to be accomplished, but not so detailed that you start programming or making design decisions.
	\item Keep the length of each use case (Global Scenario) manageable. If it's getting too long, split into sub-cases.
	\item You are \emph{not} specifying a complete and consistent set of functional requirements here. (i.e. you are providing them in the form of use cases/global scenarios, not a refined list). For the purpose of this project, you do not need to reduce them to a list; the global scenarios format is all you need.
	\item Red text below is just to highlight where you need to insert a scenario - don't actually write it all in red.
\end{itemize}

\noindent {\bf Main Business Events:} List out all the main business events you are presenting. If you sub-divided into smaller ones, you don't need to include the smaller ones in this list.\\

\noindent {\bf Viewpoints:} List out all the viewpoints you will be considering.\\

\noindent {\bf Interpretation:} Specify any liberties you took in interpreting business events, if necessary.\\

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:non-functional_requirements}


\begin{itemize}
	\item For each non-functional requirement, provide a justification/rationale for it.\\
	{\bf Example:} \\
	SC1. \emph{The device should not explode in a customer’s pocket.}\\
	{\bf Rationale:} Other companies have had issues with the batteries they used in their phones randomly exploding [insert citation]. This causes a safety issue, as the phone is often carried in a person's hand or pocket.	
	\item If you need to make a guess because you couldn't really talk to stakeholders, you can say "We imagined stakeholders would want...because..."
	\item Each requirement should have a unique label/number for it.
	\item In the list below, if a particular section doesn't apply, just write N/A so we know you considered it.
\end{itemize}

% Begin Section
\subsection{Look and Feel Requirements}
\label{sub:look_and_feel_requirements}
% Begin SubSection

\subsubsection{Appearance Requirements}
\label{ssub:appearance_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{LF-A}1. ]
	\item The system shall have a minimalistic and clean UI.
	
	{\bf Rationale:} A minimalistic and clean UI reduces visual clutter and will allow users to quickly interact with the app while avoiding unnecessary distractions.
	\item All images in the system must be high-quality with the resolution well-adjusted.
	
	{\bf Rationale:} High-quality images ensure a visually appealing and professional user experience. Low-resolution or poorly adjusted images may lead to confusion of the exact location users are looking for, and may reduce the app's credibility and engagement.
	\item The system shall use a consistent and legible font.
	
	{\bf Rationale:} Using a clear and legible font improves readability for users and ensures they can properly navigate the app while reducing extra cognitive strain when reading.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Style Requirements}
\label{ssub:style_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{LF-S}1. ]
	\item The system shall have both a light and dark mode option.
	
	{\bf Rationale:} Multiple theme modes provide flexibility and comfort for users, depending on which mode they prefer. Many users prefer dark mode for visual comfort, while others use light mode as either the default theme or in bright environments.
	\item The system must follow a gamified design and have visually appealing elements (ex. Leaderboard, user profile).
	
	{\bf Rationale:} The app has an additional game feature. Users are given an image of a location and are tasked with guessing the location. The gamified design is consistent with this feature and enhances user engagement by making the experience interactive and fun.
	\item The system must scale to the size of the screen.
		
	{\bf Rationale:} Users may have various types and sizes of devices when accessing the app, as such it is important the system scales to fit the screen size to optimize the layout and consistency of the app.
	\item The system must use consistent spacing and padding between elements.
	
	{\bf Rationale:} Proper spacing between elements improves readability and makes it harder for users to be distracted by visual inconsistencies.

% Begin SubSection

\subsubsection{Ease of Use Requirements}
\label{ssub:ease_of_use_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{UH-EOU}1. ]
	\item The system's buttons shall be big and bright in colour.
		
	{\bf Rationale:} The app's buttons would be easy to tap, and larger and brighter buttons would ensure that users can comfortably interact with them, especially on smaller screens.
	\item The system shall allow users to complete the identification of a location within four steps.
		
	{\bf Rationale:} By reducing the number of steps required to complete the system's primary task (the main motivation for downloading the app), users will experience less frustration and an efficient and simple app design.
	\item The system shall allow users to report incorrect results through a feedback tool in the application.
	
	{\bf Rationale:} Allowing users a method to report incorrect results encourages them to increase engagement with the app. This also helps maintain accuracy when providing location solutions to users, enhancing the app's reliability and user trust.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Personalization and Internationalization Requirements}
\label{ssub:personalization_and_internationalization_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{UH-PI}1. ]
	\item The system must be able to support multiple languages.
		
	{\bf Rationale:} This feature enhances user experience by providing localized content, allowing users to interact with the app in their preferred language.
	\item The system shall allow the user to select between the metric or imperial system to display information.
	
	{\bf Rationale:} Different regions use different measurement systems, improving usability on a wider scale.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Learning Requirements}
\label{ssub:learning_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{UH-L}1. ]
	\item The system shall have a basic tutorial for navigating through the features, which automatically executes the first time a user opens the app and is available at all times within the app.
		
	{\bf Rationale:} A built-in tutorial ensures that new users can quickly understand how to navigate the app’s features without overwhelming them. Having the option to review the tutorial enhances usability and accessibility for users who may have forgotten certain functions.
	\item The system shall provide short descriptions when the user presses and holds key features, that automatically fade after a short period.
	
	{\bf Rationale:} Users should be able to learn how basic functionalities work without exiting the app and using external guides.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Understandability and Politeness Requirements}
\label{ssub:understandability_and_politeness_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{UH-UP}1. ]
	\item The system shall hide information and aspects of the app construction that are necessary for the user to interact with [1].
		
	{\bf Rationale:} Hiding unnecessary technical details and background processes simplifies the user experience, making the app more intuitive and user-friendly [1].
	\item The system shall provide positive engagement with the user when they successfully identify a location.
	
	{\bf Rationale:} Positive reinforcement encourages users to continue to engage with the app and makes the experience more enjoyable and rewarding.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Accessibility Requirements}
\label{ssub:accessibility_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{UH-A}1. ]
	\item The system must be compatible with screen readers.
		
	{\bf Rationale:} Compatibility with screen readers supports visually impaired users and improves inclusivity and accessibility for a wider range of users.
	\item The system shall allow built-in zoom-in and zoom-out features.
		
	{\bf Rationale:} Zoom features improve accessibility by allowing users to adjust content visibility according to their needs.
	\item The system shall provide high-contrast options that are colorblind-friendly.
	
	{\bf Rationale:} High-contrast options ensure that users with colour vision deficiencies can comfortably use the app.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

% End SubSection

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
\label{sub:performance_requirements}
% Begin SubSection

\subsubsection{Speed and Latency Requirements}
\label{ssub:speed_and_latency_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{PR-SL}1. ]
	\item The system shall have a basic app response time of no longer than 3 seconds [2].
		
	{\bf Rationale:} According to Google recommendations for performance requirements, apps with a response time longer than 3 seconds lose over half of user engagement [2]. As such, the app must process and return information fast.
	\item The system shall return location identification results within 5 seconds.
	
	{\bf Rationale:} The system must complete its basic functions quickly, as users expect fast responses. Delays of more than a few seconds may lead to frustration and lower user engagement.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Safety-Critical Requirements}
\label{ssub:safety_critical_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{PR-SC}1. ]
	\item The system must securely encrypt all user data.
		
	{\bf Rationale:} Data encryption prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information.
	\item The system must not return locations that reveal people's addresses or sensitive information.
	
	{\bf Rationale:} Protecting user privacy is essential to prevent possible safety risks like unauthorized tracking or doxxing. This aligns with ethical data handling practices and ensures the app complies with privacy regulations.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Precision or Accuracy Requirements}
\label{ssub:precision_or_accuracy_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{PR-PA}1. ]
	\item The system must successfully return the general location of the image processed to within 25 km of the actual area.
		
	{\bf Rationale:} Returning the location result within a range balances both accuracy and feasibility. To ensure the app provides accurate and useful data for users, potential limits in AI-based location identification APIs must be accounted for.
	\item The system shall have a priority setting to assess the accuracy of each of the API's results.
	
	{\bf Rationale:} If the APIs return contrasting location results, a priority system must be implemented to assess the accuracy of each expert's results and select the most reliable response.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Reliability and Availability Requirements}
\label{ssub:reliability_and_availability_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
